            <p>Angkor Wat is a temple at Angkor, Cambodia, built in the capital city for King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century as 
            the state temple. The largest and best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious 
            center—first Hindu, then Buddhist—since its foundation. The temple is the epitome of the high classical style of Khmer 
            architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its national flag, and is the country's prime attraction for 
            visitors. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple mountain and the later galleried temple.
             It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the gods in Hindu mythology. At the center of the temple stands a quincunx of 
             towers.</p> 
             The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of its architecture and for the extensive bas-reliefs and the 
             numerous devatas adorning its walls. Unusually, Angkor Wat faces the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this

              <h2 class="red">2020–21 Premier League</h2>
                  <p>
              At the start of this season, as was the case at the end of the previous season, there was limited or no attendance at matches 
              besides each team's staff and personnel.[5] On 23 November 2020, it was announced that some fans would be allowed to return 
              to stadiums in low-risk areas at the end of the second national lockdown on 2 December 2020.[6] The announcement of a third 
              national lockdown on 4 January 2021, though, signalled a return to matches being played behind closed doors.[7] On 22 February 
              2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced as the third step of recovery from the lockdown imposed on 4 January, that 
              subject to certain criteria being met on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants, large football stadiums
               would be allowed to reopen on 17 May with a maximum of 10,000 spectators.[8]</p>
               Season summary
               The 2020–21 season began on Saturday 12 September, just seven weeks after the conclusion of the 2019–20 season.[9] 
               Liverpool were the defending champions, having won their nineteenth league title the previous season, their first in the 
               Premier League era.[2] As originally planned, the 2020–21 season was to be the second Premier League season with a mid-season
                break in February, whereby five games of a normal round of ten would be played on one weekend and the remaining five the 
                following weekend.[10] However, due to the late start of the league and fixture congestion, the winter break was scrapped.
                [11] It is also the second Premier League season to use VAR (Video Assistant Referee).[12]
                The top of the table was tight for the first months of the season, with Arsenal, Leicester City, Everton, Liverpool and 
      Southampton all having occupied first position by early November.[13] The top six were separated by only three points at that stage.
      [14] Tottenham Hotspur became the sixth different leader later that month,[15] but Liverpool overtook them again mid-December, following 
      a meeting between the two clubs at Anfield which resulted in a 2–1 win to Liverpool.[16] By Christmas, Liverpool had opened up a 
      five-point gap following a 7–0 away win against Crystal Palace.[17]
      In the new year, Liverpool suffered a slump in form, dropping down to 8th place by early March.[18] They suffered their first home 
      defeat in 68 games with a 1–0 defeat to Burnley,[19] but this was followed by which was followed by five more consecutive losses at 
      Anfield, to Brighton, Manchester City, Everton, Chelsea and Fulham.[18] Manchester United took the lead at the top of the table in 
      mid-January with a 1–0 away win against Burnley,[20] but they were in turn replaced by Manchester City at the end of the month as a
       5–0 Manchester City win over West Bromwich Albion was followed by a 2–1 home defeat for Manchester United against Sheffield United.
       [21][22]
       This was to prove the final change of team at the top, as Manchester City went on a 15-match winning streak which saw them 15 points 
   clear of second-place Manchester United after a 4–1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 2 March.[23] They went on to secure the title 
   on 12 May 2021 with three matches to spare, following a home defeat for Manchester United against Leicester. It was the club's fifth 
   Premier League title and seventh English league title overall, as well as their third title in the past four seasons.[24]
   On 17 April 2021, Sheffield United were confirmed to be the first team to be relegated to the Championship following a 1–0 defeat away 
   to Wolverhampton Wanderers with six games remaining, ending their two-year top flight tenure. [25] On 9 May 2021, West Bromwich Albion 
   became the second team to be relegated following a 3–1 defeat away to Arsenal, with three games remaining, immediately returning to the 
   Championship after a season's presence in the top flight.[26] On 10 May 2021, Fulham were the third and final team to be relegated 
   following a 2–0 defeat at home against Burnley with three games remaining, also immediately returning to the Championship after a season'
   s presence in the top flight.[27]

              <h2 class="black">London</h2>

London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[8][9] The city stands on the River Thames in the south-east of 
England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea. London has been a major settlement for two millennia, and 
was originally called Londinium, which was founded by the Romans.[10] The City of London, London's ancient core and financial centre—an 
area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile—retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval 
limits.[note 1][11][12][13][14][15] The adjacent City of Westminster has for centuries been the location of much of the national government. 
Thirty-one additional boroughs north and south of the river also comprise modern London. The London region is governed by the mayor of 
London and the London Assembly.[note 2][16][17]
London is one of the world's most important global cities.[18] It exerts considerable influence upon the arts, commerce, 
education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transportation.
[19] It is one of the largest financial centres in the world and in 2019, London had the second highest number of ultra high-net-worth 
individuals in Europe, after Paris.[20] And in 2020, London had the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe, after 
Moscow.[21] London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe,[22] and London is home to highly 
ranked institutions such as Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics, as well as the 
comprehensive University College London.[23] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games.[24]
London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region.[25] Its estimated mid-2018 municipal 
population (corresponding to Greater London) was roughly 9 million,[5] which made it the third-most populous city in Europe.[26] London 
accounts for 13.4% of the U.K. population.[27] Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, after Istanbul, Moscow, 
and Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census.[28][29] The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, after 
Istanbul and the Moscow Metropolitan Area, with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016.[note 3][4][30]
London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster 
Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich defines the Prime Meridian 
(0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time.[31] Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, 
Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square and The Shard. London has numerous museums, galleries, libraries and sporting events. These include the 
British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library and West End theatres.[32] The London Underground 
is the oldest underground railway network in the world.

              <h2>Early modern</h2>
 During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, and much of London property passed from church to 
 private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.[62] In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up its main trading base 
 (kontor) of England in London, called the Stalhof or Steelyard. It existed until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and 
 Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway.[63] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to 
 the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable.[64]
 But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and 
 the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from 
 England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued 
 a strong outburst of commercial activity.[65] The Royal Exchange was founded.[66] Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies 
 such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, 
 with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[62]
 In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre. 
 By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, 
 in the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605.[67]
 In 1637, the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the area of London. The plan called for the Corporation 
 of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to 
 diminish the Liberties of London, a lack of interest in administering these additional areas, or concern by city guilds of having to 
 share power, the Corporation refused. Later called "The Great Refusal", this decision largely continues to account for the unique 
 governmental status of the City.[68]
 Vertue's 1738 plan of the Lines of Communication, built during the English Civil War
In the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, 
culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of 
Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[69] The fortifications failed their 
only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647,[70] and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.[71]London was plagued 
by disease in the early 17th century,[72] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth 
of the population.[73]The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.
The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[74] Rebuilding 
took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke[75][76][77] as Surveyor of London.[78] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, 
St Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over 
the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an 
international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s.In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over 
the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a 
professional police force.[79] In total, more than 200 offences were punishable by death,[80] including petty theft.[81] Most children 
born in the city died before reaching their third birthday.[82]View to the Royal Exchange in the City of London in 1886 The coffeehouse 
became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available; 
and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers 
relocated to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the 
world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the 
Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international 
financial centre.[83][84] According to Samuel Johnson:You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, 
when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.
— Samuel Johnson, 1777[85]
